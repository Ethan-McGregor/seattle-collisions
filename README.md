# Exploring Collisions in Seattle
Our team created a interactive shiny application which displays visualizations of the data and help us better understand the dataset.

## The Dataset
We worked with the SDOT Collisions dataset. It contains a record of all car collisions in Seattle from 2004 to 2016. Data for car collisions is provided by the Seattle Police Department and the Washington State Department of Transportation. The dataset provides details of the collisions such as location, type, injuries, weather, and other information. The dataset can be accessed [here](https://data.seattle.gov/Transportation/SDOT-Collisions/v7k9-7dn4).

## Purpose
Our goal is to inform the public of patterns in recent car accidents in the hope that greater awareness of collision conditions can lead to safer transportation practices. Our target audience is Seattle drivers. We wonâ€™t assume that they have any specialized knowledge when presenting the data. A few specific questions that we plan to answer are:
* Is there a correlation between light and road conditions, and the severity of collisions?
* When do most collisions occur? (specifically by month)  
* Is the number of accidents per year increasing or decreasing?
